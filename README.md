# Effects of Glucose-lowering Medications on Functional Parameters of the Central Nervous System in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
# Aim
To evaluate the effect of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1ra) on functional parameters of the central
nervous system (CNS) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
# Objectives
1. To study biochemical (markers of brain damage) and functional (cognitive status) parameters in patients with T2DM.
2. To assess the effect of therapy with SGLT2i and GLP1 ra on these parameters.
# Conclusion
